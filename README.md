## Train set and Test set

This system only recommend book for users who have rated some books (maybe min 20?)

That's mean all users will be put in train set, which leads to a high score in test cause the test data used to train.

To fix it, we divide train set and test set by **Excluding 1 or 2 rating data from training each user.**

Example: 

```python
dataset
userid  bookid   rating
1		1		2
1 		2		3
1		3		4

trainset
userid  bookid   rating
1		1		2
1 		2		3

testset
userid  bookid   rating
1		3		4
```





limited size for the dataset

collect data about books with the most ratings

collect people who rated for these books data (including ratings for other books) 



books -> people who rated for the books over 20 ([reference]([Recommended for You | Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/recommendations?ref=nav_brws_recs))) -> their ratings
